The Commute is an electrically supported long board. On top of the rising trend of the electric mobility, this product is intended for the daily commuter to reach his destination. With an innovative steering device called Magic Glove, the board’s slim design and leight weight, the Commute provides great usability. The glove uses an AtMega328 microcontroller to convert the movement of a finger, measured by an integrated bending strip, into a digital signal and send it to the board. To reduce the chance of accidents caused by connecting wires, the steering glove communicates wirelessly over a 2.4GHz module. In addition this connection is used as a theft protection and also prevents it from rolling away unintentionally. To reach a controlled starting acceleration, the Commute uses a new motor control technology called Field Oriented Control or FOC. With its implementation, the board reclames energy gained from riding downhill. Due to a high performance microcontroller called STM32F3, the very difficult calculations from this technology are handled withe ease. The Commute also has a charging circuit that is able to charge the internal Lithium Polymer battery simply by attaching the charging cable. To provide longer battery life, the charging circuit measures the cell voltages and ensures that they stay balanced. The charging state is visualized by three LEDs which represent charging, ready and fully charged. An AtMega328 microcontroller charges the battery, balances the cells and controls the charging current flowing into the cells. With all these technologies, we were able to create an electrically supported long board that is very convinient for commuters as well as for hobby users.
