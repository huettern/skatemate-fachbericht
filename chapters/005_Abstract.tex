The Commute from the development group Skatemate is an electrically supported long board. On top of the rising trend of the electric mobility, this product is intended for the daily commuter to reach his destination. With an innovative steering device called Magic Glove, the board’s slim design and low weight, the Commute provides great usability. The glove uses an AtMega328 microcontroller to convert finger movement, measured by an attached bending strip, into a digital signal and send it to the board. To reduce the chance of accidents caused by a controlling cord, the steering glove communicates wirelessly over a 2.4GHz module. Simultaneously this connection is used as a theft and roll away protection. To reach a controlled starting acceleration, the Commute uses a new motor control technology called Field Oriented Control or FOC. With its implementation, the board will also be able to reclame energy gained from driving downhill. To handle the very difficult calculations from this technology, the motor controller uses a high performance microcontroller called STM32F3. To provide maximum comfort, the Commute has a charging circuit built in that can charge the internal Lithium Polymer battery by just plugging in the charging cable. To provide longer battery durability, the charging circuit measures the cell voltages and ensures that they are balanced. The charging state is visualized by three LEDs representing charging, ready and fully charged. The charging circuitry uses an AtMega328 microcontroller to run the logic, balance the cells and control the charging current flowing into the cells. With all these technologies, we were able to create an electrically supported long board that is very handy for commuters as well as for spare time users.
